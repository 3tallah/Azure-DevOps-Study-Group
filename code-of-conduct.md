## Respect everyone
Please respect everyone as it is important no matter what is the gender, religion, opinion, age, etc and we don't argue or discuss any of that.

## Using your microphone during the session
Please mute your mic all the time if you are not speaking, only unmute your mic when you are speaking and mute it again immediately after you stop talking.

## Speaking during sessions
Anyone can speak at any time during the session but please respect everyone and don't interrupt each other and give everyone space and room to speak and explain.

## Post session survey
The post session survey is very important. The improvement and the decisions regarding the next session is always based on survey. So, please try to make all effort to fill it.

Only new user registers by reaching out to me on Linked-In:<br>[Linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedahmedradwan/)

## Do I need to register for every event/session
No, you don't need to register for every event, once you registered for one event, you will get notification by email for all future events.

## I want to contribute to the open source project on GitHub, can you add me?
I don't add people to the repo, you need to create a fork of the repo in your GitHub account and start working, once you have something nice :-)  raise a pull request and so on.

By providing pull requests which has good work, you will get good reputation and trust among the community and among us.

## I don't want to receive any invitation or emails anymore?
Please reach out to me on Linked-In and let me know, and we will remove you from the mailing list.

## Chat and discussion during the live session
Usually, there is no moderator for the chat, if there is, it will be announced in the beginning of the session and if there is no announcement, it means you should not expect reply in the chat window, but you may get reply from people attending.

## I have issue in the chat area during the session and I can't send message?
We didn't disable the chat for anyone, most people have no issue, try to reconnect, if it's still not working, there is no option to do from our side.

## How to join the meeting?
If you register, you will get an email invite which has the meeting link. 

## Do I need to install Microsoft Teams?
No, it's even better you don't, you can use the browser only and join as a guest which means you don't even need a Microsoft account to join, find more info here:<br>

## I have issue joining the meeting using MS Teams?
Most people joining the meeting without any issue following the instructions provided in the event post on the Facebook page, if you have any issue, it could be regarding your machine configuration or due the meeting reaches out the maximum number (250).  You still can watch the event live on YouTube or even recorded video later on the same YouTube channel.

## I registered but I didn't get an invitation?
Please try to double-check your email, junk folder and so on, if you still can't find the invitation, please register again and make sure you type your email correctly. We saw many registered people added wrong emails.

## If I can't join the live session, can I still watch it?
Yes, all events will be broadcasted live on YouTube and you can still watch it but the questions will not be monitored during the session.

## If I can't join the live session on MS Teams either the live broadcast on YouTube, is there any video record for the event?
Yes, all events/sessions will be video recorded and will be published on YouTube with high quality video on the following link:

[Past events/sessions](https://www.youtube.com/user/MRadwanMSF/playlists)



## I want to contribute but I don't know what to do?
You need to learn what does it means to be a contributor and I am trying to help everyone here.
There are only 3 ways to do thatâ€¦..

1. If you donâ€™tâ€™ like anything, you see an improvement or you have a suggestion, just fork and do it in your repo then raise a PR (Pull Request).

1. If you donâ€™t want to do it, just raise an issue/enhancement/bug, etc. on GitHub
   

## What if I raised a Pull Request (PR) and itâ€™s not accepted?
It itâ€™s not accepted without any comments, it means you failed to provide any value, therefore always do a PR which has small changes and learn how to provide values. Just think if you can really provide a value, no one will reject that value even if itâ€™s very small but if your PR has many changes and the feedback will take longer time than to do the task, probably you will not receive a feedback.
E.g. if you correct a spelling mistake in few words or fix broken links and raise a PR, no one will reject that ðŸ˜Š
So, again, always do a small PR and learn from the feedback from your mistakes.

## What is needed to contributor to the community?
You need to learn the culture of the community, some of that as the following:
- Honest and transparent
- Contributor vs. Consumer
- Initiative and Proactive vs. Reactive 
- Actions vs. suggestions
- Deep reading and attention to details
- Do your homework first before asking for help or for more info
- Welling to help before seeking recognition
- Quality of contribution  
- Welling and looking for feedback even if itâ€™s not very good :-) 
- Community only opens the door, you have to walk through it

## Can I ask any question regarding any subject outside the session topic?
**If you are in Group (A) session**

You are only allowed to ask related questions to the discussed topics.
Most of the questions will be at the end of the session, but you can ask a few questions during the session.
